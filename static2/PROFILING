Now that we have a testing framework, we want the ability to stress test our static engine. Therefore we may need to make use of profiling.

This can be done with Python:

pip install gprof2dot
python -m cProfile -s time -o testing.prof testing.py
gprof2dot -f pstats testing.prof | dot -Tpng -o testing_prof.png
